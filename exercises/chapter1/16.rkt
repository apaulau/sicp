;; Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses
;; a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt. (Hint: Using the observation that (b^{n/2})^2 = (b^2)^{n/2}, keep, 
;; along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional state variable a, and define the state transformation in such
;; a way that the product ab^n is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and
;; the answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an invariant
;; quantity that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)
